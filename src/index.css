/* ✅ THE DEFINITIVE FIX:
  This is the most important part. It sets the HTML document, the body, 
  and the root div where your React app lives to all have a full, unbroken height.
  This allows the `min-h-screen` class inside your components to work correctly.

/* ✅ SAFETY NET:
  This sets the background color on the body itself. So even if something
  were to break in the future, the background you see will be your app's
  dark color, NOT the default browser white.
